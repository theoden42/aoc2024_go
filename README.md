# Advent of Code 2024 in Go 

Here I store my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 written in Go. 

Problems that I found interesting 

- Resonant Collinearity Day 8 
    This problem's part 2 provides a little opportunity to use simple geometry, which is cool. A cute GCD based solution is also present. 
- Plutonian Pebbles Day 11 
    Really nice problems first time you encounter an algorithmic challenge and it's not that hard either. 
- Claw Contraption Day 13
    Nice system of equations problem also the first part is this time actually an easy version of the hard problem and not a completely different problem altogether
- Restroom Redoubt Day 14 
    The part two of the problem is extremely nice, makes you think a little and can be solved with a lot of clever ideas.
